*Little Finger; Ring Finger; Middle Finger*:
"Lower - Middle Limb 4" - Updated v1.stl" x 2 (for each of fingers) + "Upper Limb 1 - Little finger - Latest v1.stl"(for little finger) or "Upper Limb 1 - Index finger v1.stl" (for ring finger if it is a female hand as the length of Index finger and ring finger is almost same for females) or for middle finger you can still use index finger's upper limb or make another one, the hand is modular and customisable and different sizes of finger limbs does not avoid hand from working, however the connections and holes for the tubes should be properly made and placed.
